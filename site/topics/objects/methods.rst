******************************
Objects II --- More on Methods
******************************

* The ``Circle`` class discussed in the previous topic introduced:

    * How to write classes
    * How to write and make use of a constructor
    * Attributes, both how to set them and how to access them
    * How to write and use methods
    * How to make instances of the class

* In this topic, we will create more classes containing more complex functionality
* Additionally, we will see objects interacting with one another and how objects can provide a nice level of abstraction
