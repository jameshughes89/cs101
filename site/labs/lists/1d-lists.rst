* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Pre Lab Exercises
=================

* For all exercises

    * Do **not** make a ``vector.py`` file, just use Colab like you have been
    * Use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function


#. `Chapter 11 exercise(s) <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html#exercises>`_

    * 5
    * 6
	* 7


#. Write assertion tests for each of your functions above



Before Kattis
=============

#. Write a function ``linear_search(needle, haystack) -> bool:``

    * The function will ``return`` ``True`` if ``needle`` exists within the list ``haystack`` and ``False`` otherwise
    * This can use either a ``for`` loop or a ``while`` loop
    * Write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness


#. Write a function ``index_of(needle, haystack) -> int:``

    * The function will ``return`` the index of the first occurrence of ``needle`` within the list ``haystack`` and ``-1`` if it is not found
    * This can use either a ``for`` loop or a ``while`` loop
    * Write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness


#. Write a function ``replace_all(the_list, find, replace):``

    * This function will replace all occurrences of ``find`` within ``the_list`` and replace them with ``replace``
    * This function must ``return`` the modified list
    * For example, ``replace_all([1, 2, 2, 3], 2, 9)`` -> ``[1, 9, 9, 3]``
    * Write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness


#. Use the ``replace_all`` function to change the list ``[1, 2, 2, 1]`` -> ``[2, 1, 1, 2]``

    * You will need to use ``replace_all`` multiple times



Kattis Problems
===============

* You should be using a scrap piece of paper to work out the ideas for the following problems

    * The problems you are to solve are getting too complex to try to solve by just coding
    * Trying to solve problems by just typing away will not yield success
