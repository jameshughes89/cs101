*******************
Propositional Logic
*******************

* Sometimes things are ``True`` or ``False``

    * This course focuses on introductory computer science --- ``True``
    * This topic is titled "Not Logic" --- ``False``

* This is rather intuitive since you use this type of simple logic in every day life to make decisions
* Additionally, you are alreay familiar with some *operators* we can use on these ``True``/``False`` statements

    * ``and``
    * ``or``
    * ``not``


Truth Table
===========

.. list-table:: Truth Table
    :widths: 50 50 50 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - ``A``
      - ``B``
      - ``A and B``
      - ``A or B``
      - ``not A``
    * - ``True``
      - ``True``
      - ``True``
      - ``True``
      - ``False``
    * - ``True``
      - ``False``
      - ``False``
      - ``True``
      - ``False``
    * - ``False``
      - ``True``
      - ``False``
      - ``True``
      - ``True``
    * - ``False``
      - ``False``
      - ``False``
      - ``False``
      - ``True``


* The above *truth table* is a rather formal representation of some everyday ideas
* To put it slightly different

    * Is *the sky blue* ``and`` is *water wet*? --- ``True``
    * Is *the sky blue* ``and`` is it *over 100 degreed Celsius outside*? --- ``False``
    * Is *the sky blue* ``or`` is it *over 100 degreed Celsius outside*? --- ``True``
    * Is it ``not`` *over 100 degreed Celsius outside*? --- ``True``
    * Is *the sky blue* ``and`` is it ``not`` *over 100 degreed Celsius outside*? --- ``True``


* You may have observed that

    * For ``and``, both statements must be ``True`` to produce ``True``, otherwise it is ``False``
    * For ``or``, only one statement must be ``True`` to produce ``True``, otherwise it is ``False``
    * ``not`` changes ``True`` -> ``False`` and ``False`` -> ``True``

.. note::

    For ``or``, both statements being ``True`` produces ``True``. There is another operator called *exclusive or* that
    is ``True`` only when one of the statements is ``True``. Exclusive or is not going to come up in this course. It is
    only noted here since some people find ``or`` ambiguous at first.

* To make parts of the program *conditionally* executed, we need a *formal* way to describe conditions.
* We need: logic.
* Let's try some comparison:
    >>> 19 == 87
    False

    >>> 5 == 5
    True

* Note that ``==`` is *comparison* while ``=`` is *assignment*. They are not the same! Python will punish you if you forget this!
    * You'll all mess this up eventually
    * Just be thankful this isn't C/C++

.. admonition:: Activity

    Figure out what the other comparison operators in Python are. Hint: ``3`` doesn't equal ``5``, it is *____ than* 5.

* These operators can be applied to any two expressions (could be simply a value or variable, but can be more complex):
    >>> a = 15
    >>> b = 37
    >>> (a+b)*9 > (b-a)*3 + 2
    True

* What is the *type* of the result of applying a comparison operator?





The Boolean type
================
* A value that is either ``True`` or ``False`` (and nothing else) has type `Boolean <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole>`_.
* We've used comparison operators (e.g., ``<, >, ==``) in conditionals.
* What's going on "under the hood" with the comparison, though?
    >>> 5 > 2
    True
    
    >>> 5 < 2
    False
	
* A comparison like ``a > b`` is just an *expression*, like ``a + b``.
* The difference is that the value it produces isn't an integer, it's either ``True`` or ``False``
* This may seem like a subtle thing, but it's a big deal:
    * An operator that takes 2 numbers and produces a number: 
        * `1 + 1 -> 2`
    * An operator that takes 2 booleans and produces a boolean: 
        * `True and False -> False`
    * An operator that athes 2 numbers and produces a boolean: 
        * `1 < 2 -> True`
   

    >>> type(5 > 2)
    <class 'bool'>

    Write a function ``is_negative(n)`` that *returns* ``True`` if the argument ``n`` is negative and ``False`` otherwise.

    Verify that the return type is correct.

More about returns
==================

* We've already seen that functions can return a value at the end.
* In fact, a function can return a value *at any time*, not just the end.
* We can take advantage of this fact to have multiple returns!::

    def divisible_by(a, b):
        if a % b == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

.. admonition:: Activity

    * What is the result of the function call ``divisible_by(4, 2)``? 
    * How about ``divisible_by(4, 3)``? 
    * Now write a new function ``not_divisible_by(a, b)`` that returns ``True`` when ``a`` is *not* divisible by ``b`` and ``False`` otherwise.
    * Now write this function to do the same thing with only **1** return statement.
    * Now write it with only **1** line of code within the function (so, 2 lines including the function header).
   
* Functions returning Boolean values are pretty handy. Why? Where do you see yourself using them?
