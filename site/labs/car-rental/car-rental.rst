Before Kattis
=============

.. image:: /topics/car-rental/carRental.png

A car rental place needs our help. They want a program to calculate how much a customer is to be charged based on their
rental agreement, age, how far they drove, and how long they had the car.

.. note::
   
    Obviously this is directly from lecture. Do not just copy/paste the solution --- take this as an opportunity to
    re-implement the solution from scratch while taking care to truly understand what is going on. In fact, I will be
    very happy if you have slightly different solutions than what I provided in lecture. Use this lab to work out what
    you understand in the course and what you don't quite understand yet.

**Rules:**


* We will get and record the customer's:

    * Age
    * Rental agreement classification code (B or D)
    * Number of days rented
    * Starting odometer reading
    * Ending odometer reading

* If the classification code is **B**

    * Base charge of $20.00/day
    * Plus $0.30 for every km driven

* If the classification is **D**

    * Base charge of $50.00/day
    * Plus $0.30 for every km driven above the 100km/day average allowance

* All renters under the age of 25 are charged an additional $10.00/day


Kattis Problems
===============

* Work on the Kattis problems you have not solved from previous weeks
* Remember, I encourage you to work with others to solve the problems
