Assignments
===========

Submission
----------

Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student's responsibility
to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the assignment
receiving a mark of zero.

You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment
descriptions. We reserve the right to use similarity detection software to detect possible cheating cases.


Due Dates
---------

The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications. No submissions will be taken
after the due date; there are no late submissions. No extensions will be given for assignments.


Marking
-------

Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors.

A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available
after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your
assignment). Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why
you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as
well as the original marker's grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process
is complete.

It is each student's responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or
inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded
assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials
until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.


Recoupment
----------

Since mistakes are expected and lost marks are meant to provide feedback and not intended to be a penalty, students can
redeem 50% of their lost marks via *assignment recoupment*.

Students will have **1 week** after their marked assignment is returned to incorporate feedback, correct mistakes, and
resubmit their assignments for additional marking. All corrected mistakes can recoup 50% of the lost marks on that
assignment. For example, if a student obtained 80/100 on the assignment after the regular submission, and the student
correctly fixes errors that account for 12 of the 20 lost marks and resubmits for recoupment, the student will gain 6
more marks for a total of 86/100 on the assignment. As always, no late submissions will be accepted and all work will be
checked for plagiarism or cheating.

There are some conditions, however. The marker will inform the student if their assignment is eligible for recoupment;
only assignments deemed eligible may be resubmitted. Only assignments that were completed and attempted in earnest are
eligible. Students with missing code/functions/portions of the assignment will not be eligible. If the student has
portions of code that demonstrate a lack of a sincere attempt, the assignment will not be eligible for recoupment.

Further, it is the responsibility of the student to make clear to the marker what exactly has been updated and changed.
If the marker is unable to quickly determine what fixes the student has made, the resubmission will not be considered
for recoupment. This could be in the form of notes in the Moodle submission with corresponding comments within the code. 


Tests
=====

No cheating of any form is allowed. Tests and exams are closed book/laptop/notebook/etc. and calculators, cell phones
and/or similar devices are not permitted. The possession of unauthorized devices during tests and examinations
constitutes violation of academic integrity, as per section 3.8.2(b)(v) of the academic calendar. Further, anything that
a reasonable person would deem as cheating is not permitted and will be investigated fully as academic misconduct.

Test format will be in person; however, if necessary, the format *may* be changed to online. Students will be informed
of the change as soon as possible. 


Missed Midterm
--------------

There are no make up midterms. If a student is unable to write the midterm, the weight of their midterm will be added to
the weight of the final exam; the final exam will be worth 50% of the student's final grade,


Labs
====

The purpose of the weekly labs is to give students hands-on experience. Labs will have required assigned work and will
revolve around `Kattis <https://open.kattis.com/>`_.


Labs begin on the 1st week of class for lab sections 11 and 12. Lab sections 13, and 14 begin week 2.

Pre lab exercises must be completed before the start of the lab. Students who have not completed the pre-lab exercises
will be asked to leave.

Lab exercises must be completed for marks; attendance and lab completion is mandatory. Each completed lab is worth 1% of
the final grade (to a maximum of 10%). It is your responsibility to ensure your attendance and exercise completion is
recorded.

There is are a total of 12 labs, however there is potential that some labs may be cancelled. In the case where there are
less than 10 labs, your individual grades will be adjusted such that each lab is wroth the amount necessary to ensure
the lab portion of the final grade is still 10%.

You may only attend the lab session for which you are registered. Students must bring their student identification to
all labs.


Email Contact
=============

**Email etiquette** --- Emails should be addressed to Dr./Prof. Hughes or Delamer.

I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email
address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may
wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address.

Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you
let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing
email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent.

Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding
lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should
check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX
account and include CSCI 161 in the subject line of the email. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during
office hours.


Office Hours
============

Office hours are provided to students to facilitate their success --- students are encouraged to come to office hours.

Students must understand that the professors and TAs are not there to provide them answers to problems, but to assist
students solving their problems.

As per university policy, masking and proper social distancing is required. Students refusing to follow this policy will
be asked to leave.


Attendance
==========

Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Associate Dean. See section 3.7 of the
academic calendar for more details.

You will be reported to Dr. Cathy MacDonald, Associate Dean, Academic Affairs' Office if you are repeatedly delinquent
in assignments or attendance at classes or laboratories.


Copyright Policy
================

The materials in CSCI 161 at StFX are the property of the instructor, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Online
posting or selling this material to third parties for distribution without permission is subject to Canadian Copyright
law and is strictly prohibited.

The course copyright policy will be aggressively enforced. 


Class Recording Policy
======================

Students may not create audio and/or video recordings of classes. Students creating unauthorized recording of lectures
violate an instructor's intellectual property rights and the Canadian Copyright Act. Students violating this policy will
be subject to disciplinary actions.


Statement of Academic Offenses
===============================

Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.

It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.


Use of Plagiarism-Checking Software
===================================

All required papers/submissions may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for such
checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of
papers subsequently submitted to the system.


Use of Cheating-Analysis Software
=================================

All submitted work may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual
coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating (MOSS).


Tutoring
========

The role of tutoring is to help students understand course material. Tutors should not write assignments or take-home
tests for the students who hire them.


Statement on Accommodation of Religious Observances
===================================================

Requests for accommodation of specific religious or spiritual observance must be presented in writing to the instructor
within the fist two weeks of class.


Statement for Students with Disabilities
========================================

Students who have a disability and who require academic accommodations must register with the Centre for Accessible
Learning as early as possible in order to receive accommodations. http://sites.stfx.ca/accessible_learning/

The Tramble Center for Accessible Learning welcomes students with documented permanent disabilities and offers them a
student-centered program of support. Located in Room 108 of the Angus L. MacDonald Library, new and returning students
meet with program staff to discuss options for support. Deadline for registering with the Center is two weeks prior to
the end of classes each semester and 3 Business Days' notice is required for booking all accommodated tests and exams.

To book an appointment please use the following:
* link --- http://stfxcal.mywconline.com
* Phone --- 902 867 5349
* Email --- tramble@stfx.ca


Academic Accommodation for Medical Illness
==========================================

Those unable to attend class, submit an assignment, or write a test, should refer to sections 3.7 and 3.9 of the
academic calendar.


Scent Policy
============

For the benefit of the many students that have a scent sensitivity, my classroom is a no-scent zone; please respect this
policy.


Equity
======

Everyone learns more effectively in a respectful, safe and equitable learning environment, free from discrimination and
harassment. We invite you to work with me to create a classroom space – both real and virtual – that fosters and
promotes values of human dignity, equity, non-discrimination and respect for diversity.

Please feel free to talk with us about your questions or concerns about equity in our classroom or in the STFX community
in general. If we cannot answer your questions or help you address your concerns, we encourage you to talk to the
Chair/Coordinator of the Department/Program or the Human Rights and Equity Advisor. Please note that a Human Rights and
Equity Advisor will soon be appointed. In the meantime, students, faculty, or staff may also contact the Director of
Human Resources at hr@stfx.ca or the Office of the AVP&P.


Preferred Pronouns
==================

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class
rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. Please advise me of this preference early in the
semester. See policies at http://www2.mystfx.ca/equity/policies
