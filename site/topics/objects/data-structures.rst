Objects III --- Data Structures
*******************************

* We have spent much of the course learning how to write algorithms
* But we also saw a few data structures

    * Lists
    * Tuples
    * Sets
    * Dictionaries

* Although these data structures had clear functionality associated with them, we use them as a mechanism for storing and managing data
* They may also provide some other benefits

    * Ability to index
    * Efficient lookups
    * Easy tp search
    * Ordering the data
    * Managing duplicates
    * ...
