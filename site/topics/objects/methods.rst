******************************
Objects II --- More on Methods
******************************

* The ``Circle`` class discussed in the previous topic introduced:

    * How to write classes
    * How to write and make use of a constructor
    * Attributes, both how to set them and how to access them
    * How to write and use methods
    * How to make instances of the class

* In this topic, we will create more classes containing more complex functionality
* Additionally, we will see objects interacting with one another and how objects can provide a nice level of abstraction


Point3D Class
=============

* We will start with the ``Point3D`` class since it will be utilized by the ``Sphere`` class
* The class will have three attributes that represent a position within some three dimensional space with a Cartesian coordinate system

    * ``x``
    * ``y``
    * ``z``

* The class will also have a few methods that may come in handy for the ``Sphere`` class

    * A method for measuring the ``Point3D``\s distance from the origin
    * A method for measuring the distance from another ``Point3D`` object
    * A method for finding the midpoint between two points

* The class will also make use of some handy *magic methods* --- methods you don't invoke *directly* (more on this later)

    * A method for checking if two ``Point3D`` objects are *equal*
    * A method for generating a nice, human readable string representation of the object
