Unittest
********

* You may have noticed that our simple ``assert`` tests are becoming more difficult to write as our programs grow in complexity
* For example, consider the ``Circle``, ``Point3D``, and ``Sphere`` classes

    * There is some setup required for tests (e.g. creating an instance of a class)
    * The ``assert`` tests get jumbled together
    * It is not easy to know what the test is testing just by doing a quick look
    * There are many similar tests with redundant test code

* Fortunately, Python provides tools for helping us test our code --- ``unittest``

* ``unittest`` provides a lot of functionality

    * Special assert methods
    * Automated testing
    * Sharing setup/shutdown methods
    * Subtests
    * Nicer test result reporting
    * ...

* We will only scratch the surface here, but there is a lot one can do with ``unittest``

* Fortunately, the basic idea of testing is the same with ``unittest`` as it is with our simple ``assert`` tests


Starting a Unit Test Class
==========================

* The first thing we need to do to start writing our unit tests with ``unittest`` is to import it
* Then we need to start defining a class

    * Our tests are actually going to be written within a class

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import unittest

    class SphereTest(unittest.TestCase):
        # Tests go here


* In the above example, you will see the import and the start of the class

    * Although it is not needed on Colab, depending on how we have our tests setup, we may need to import the class being tested

* As a convention, we call our test classes ``SomeClassTest``, where ``SomeClass`` is the name of the class we are testing

    * Since the tests will be fore the ``Sphere`` class, we call it ``SphereTest``

* You will also notice the ``unittest.TestCase`` within parentheses next to the class name

    * The nuance of what this means is outside the scope of this course, but in short, we need it in order to make use of the ``unittest`` framework


Writing Unit Tests
==================

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import unittest

    class SphereTest(unittest.TestCase):

        def test_sphere_centre_point_returns_correct_point3D(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 1)
            self.assertEqual(Point3D(0, 0, 0), sphere.centre_point)

        def test_sphere_radius_returns_correct_radius(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 1)
            self.assertEqual(1, sphere.radius)


* Above are two tests confirming the correctness of the constructor and the assigning of the ``Sphere`` class' attributes
* Key things to note here are

    * The tests are methods that belong to the class
    * Each method's parameter list is just ``self``
    * Each method starts with the name ``test_``

        * The method names are descriptive so it's easy to know what it tests
        * The ``test_`` prefix is required, but after ``test_``, the name does not matter

    * We make use of ``assertEqual``, which is a method referenced by the ``self`` reference variable

        * Although we did not write this method, we inherit it from ``unittest.TestCase``
        * We used ``assertEqual`` here, but there are many other methods for various types of tests, some of which will be covered here

    * The method provides a simple mechanism for setup code to be grouped with the test itself

        * Create a ``Sphere`` object
        * Test something about the object

    * Each test should test one thing

        * This makes it easier to isolate what exactly went wrong


* Other than those points, so far there is not much more to point out here since we have been writing tests for a while
* The basic idea of how we write the tests is the same
* The only difference is the syntax of writing the tests with ``unittest``


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import unittest

    class SphereTest(unittest.TestCase):

        # Other test methods not shown for brevity

        def test_equals_on_equal_spheres_returns_true(self):
            sphere_a = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 1)
            sphere_b = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 1)
            self.assertEqual(sphere_a, sphere_b)

        def test_equals_on_not_equal_spheres_returns_false(self):
            sphere_a = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 1)
            sphere_b = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 2)
            self.assertNotEqual(sphere_a, sphere_b)

        def test_equal_on_sphere_and_string_returns_false(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 4)
            self.assertNotEqual("Sphere(centre_point=Point3D(x=1, y=2, z=3), radius=4)", sphere)

        def test_repr_arbitrary_sphere_returns_correct_string(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(1, 2, 3), 4)
            self.assertEqual("Sphere(centre_point=Point3D(x=1, y=2, z=3), radius=4)", str(sphere))


* Above are additional tests for the magic methods ``__eq__`` and ``__repr__``
* For two of the ``__eq__`` methods, you will see the setup is a little more involved as we need two ``Sphere`` objects for the test
* You will also notice the use of ``assertNotEqual``, which is just another type of test

* Although all test methods must start with ``test_``, as a convention for consistency and readability, method names will follow a pattern

    * ``test_method_condition_expected``

* One of the above examples is  ``test_equals_on_equal_spheres_returns_true``

    * ``equals`` is the method being tested
    * ``on_equal_spheres`` is the condition
    * ``returns_true`` is what is expected



Subtests
--------

* Often we have functionality we would like to test on various cases
* But it feels rather silly writing a whole new test for each case

* Consider the ``diameter`` method
* What cases should be tested?
* We want to check our edge cases and general cases

    * Test a ``Sphere`` at the origin that has zero ``radius``
    * Test a ``Sphere`` at the origin with non-zero ``radius``

* But we may want to confirm that the ``centre_point`` has no impact on the ``diameter`` of the ``Sphere``

    * Test a ``Sphere`` that exists in an arbitrary location with zero ``radius``
    * Test a ``Sphere`` that exists in an arbitrary location with non-zero ``radius``

* To test all four example cases the same way as the above tests, we would need four separate tests that are nearly identical

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import unittest

    class SphereTest(unittest.TestCase):

        # Other test methods not shown for brevity

        def test_diameter_radius_zero_origin_returns_zero(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 0)
            self.assertEqual(0, sphere.diameter())

        def test_diameter_radius_one_origin_returns_two(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 1)
            self.assertEqual(2, sphere.diameter())

        def test_diameter_radius_zero_arbitrary_centre_returns_zero(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(1, 1, 1), 0)
            self.assertEqual(0, sphere.diameter())

        def test_diameter_radius_ten_arbitrary_centre_returns_twenty(self):
            sphere = Sphere(Point3D(10, 11, 12), 10)
            self.assertEqual(20, sphere.diameter())


* Although there is nothing wrong with the above tests, we can instead, we can make use of ``subTest`` in this scenario


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 15, 16

    import unittest

    class SphereTest(unittest.TestCase):

        # Other test methods not shown for brevity

        def test_diameter_various_spheres_returns_correct_diameter(self):
            cases = [
                Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 0),
                Sphere(Point3D(0, 0, 0), 1),
                Sphere(Point3D(1, 1, 1), 0),
                Sphere(Point3D(10, 11, 12), 10.1),
            ]
            expecteds = [0, 2, 0, 20.2]
            for (case, expect) in zip(cases, expecteds):
                with self.subTest():
                    self.assertAlmostEqual(expect, case.diameter(), 5)


* In the above example, each test input and expected output were stored in lists

    * I used two separate lists, but there is nothing stopping you from using one list of tuples
    * The variable names for the lists, ``cases`` and ``expecteds``, were arbitrary and by no means required

* Notice the loop --- there is nothing particularly important for the ``subTest`` here, but the ``zip`` function has not been seen yet

    * This just provides an easy way to loop over data within two lists at the same time
    * This whole portion could be re-written as follows

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            cases = [...]
            expecteds = [...]
            for i in range(len(cases)):
                with self.subTest():
                    self.assertAlmostEqual(cases[i], expecteds[i].diameter(), 5)


* It is possible to do multiple tests within a single test by just using a loop without the use of ``subTest``
* However, without ``subTest``, if one of the tests fail, execution of the rest of the tests would stop and I would not know which subtest failed

* Also notice the use of ``self.assertAlmostEqual``
* Almost equal is a nice way to manage floating point precision issues, and in the above example we specified the precision we care about --- ``5``


Running Unit Tests
==================

* Depending on your programming environment, the ``unittest`` tests may run automatically or may need to be run with a few clicks
* In our case, on Colab, we will need to run the tests with a line of code

    * ``unittest.main(argv=[''], verbosity=2, exit=False)``

* That's it --- if you wrote all your ``unittest`` tests on Colab, and you then run that line of code, it will run all your tests
* For now, ignore the arguments provided to the ``unittest.main`` call --- they're just needed to make it work

* After running your tests, if everything ran correctly, you will likely see something like this as output

* To generate the error for demonstration purposes, I changed the ``test_distance_between_centres_various_spheres_returns_correct_distance`` test to be wrong
* You will see that the output from the test is a lot more helpful than the simple ``assert`` tests we used to write

    * It is telling us which test failed
    * It is telling us which *subtest* failed
    * It tells us what was expected
    * It tells us what we actually got
    * Just because a test failed, all other tests still ran


* Writing and running these tests may feel like a lot of work
* But writing code is only part of your job when programming
* Demonstrating that your code is correct, to yourself or anyone else that may use your code, is another big part of writing code
