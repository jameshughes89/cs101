* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Pre Lab Exercises
=================

#. `Chapter 8 exercise(s) <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/strings.html#exercises>`_

    * 3
    * 9 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended
    * 10 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended
    * 11 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended
    * 12 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended
    * 13 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended

#. Write assertion tests for each of your functions above


Before Kattis
=============

#. Write a function ``character_is_in_while(needle: str, haystack:str) -> bool:``

    * The function will ``return`` ``True`` if ``needle`` exists within ``haystack`` and ``False`` otherwise
    * This function must use a ``while`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_in_for(needle: str, haystack:str) -> bool:``

    * The function will ``return`` ``True`` if ``needle`` exists within ``haystack`` and ``False`` otherwise
    * This function must use a ``for`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_at_while(needle: str, haystack:str) -> int:``

    * The function will ``return`` the index of the first occurrence of ``needle`` within ``haystack`` and ``-1`` if it is not found
    * This function must use a ``while`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_at_for(needle: str, haystack:str) -> int:``

    * The function will ``return`` the index of the first occurrence of ``needle`` within ``haystack`` and ``-1`` if it is not found
    * This function must use a ``for`` loop


Kattis Problems
===============

* You should be using a scrap piece of paper to work out the ideas for the following problems

    * The problems you are to solve are getting too complex to try to solve by just coding
    * Trying to solve problems by just typing away will not yield success

.. note::

    If you find yourself having a particularly difficult time on any of the problems, just move on to the next one.
