***********************************
Objects III --- Interacting Objects
***********************************

* We completed the ``Sphere`` class in the previous topic, and it will work for our needs
* However, there are a few things we could do to improve the design and implementation
* One idea is to make a ``Point3D`` class to manage all the point related things

    * Location in three dimensional space
    * Distance between points
    * Equality on points

* Although there is nothing wrong with the original ``Sphere`` implementation, let's consider that

    * It will make our ``Sphere`` class simpler and easier to understand
    * It allows us to write the methods at a higher-level of abstraction since can deal with ``Point3D`` objects instead of individual coordinates
    * If we wanted to make other three dimensional shapes, they could use something like a ``Point3D`` class to represent their position
    * It allows us to abstract and delegate some functionality to another class
    * It will help with testing since we can test the ``Point3D`` class' functionality and the ``Sphere``\s independently


Point3D Class
=============

* We will start with the ``Point3D`` class since it will be utilized by the ``Sphere`` class
* The class will have three attributes that represent a position within some three dimensional space with a Cartesian coordinate system

    * ``x``
    * ``y``
    * ``z``

* The class will also have a few methods that may come in handy for the ``Sphere`` class

    * A method for measuring the ``Point3D``\s distance from the origin
    * A method for measuring the distance from another ``Point3D`` object
    * A method for finding the midpoint between two points

* The class will also make use of some handy *magic methods* --- methods you don't invoke *directly* (more on this later)

    * A method for checking if two ``Point3D`` objects are *equal*
    * A method for generating a nice, human readable string representation of the object


Constructor and Attributes
--------------------------

* Below is the start of the ``Point3D`` class, including the constructor and assignment of the attributes
* You will find it follows the same pattern as the ``Circle`` class already discussed
* The only real differences are trivial

    * The ``import math``, which will help with some geometry calculations
    * The name of the class is different
    * The parameters the ``__init__`` method has
    * The attributes


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import math


    class Point3D:
        """
        A class for representing points in a three dimensional (3D) space.
        """

        def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, z: float):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.z = z


* That's it --- that's all we need to get started with the ``Point3D`` class
* Like before, we can even start making instances of the ``Point3D`` class
* Though, also like before, the class is not particularly helpful without the required methods
