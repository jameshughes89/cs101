********************************
Testing Your Code and Type Hints
********************************

* Writing code is a big part of your job when programming
* But testing and debugging your code is a bigger part


Testing
=======

* Once you write a function, you need to ensure that it is actually correct

    * Once a function is written we often call it a few times to check that it is doing what we expect
    * But we want to be a little more systematic and through in our tests

* We end up writing small snippets of code designed to test our code
* In addition to ensure correctness, writing tests for our code also helps us *think* about our code more

    * You will have to think about what is correct/incorrect
    * Think about the different cases that your function needs to deal with
    * If there are any *edge cases*
