General Assignment Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
***************************************************

* I don't know how to do *X*

    * This is typical and sometimes intentional
    * Go to `google.ca <https://www.google.ca>`_ and type in *X*
    * This is not to dismiss your question --- it's how experienced programmers figure out how to do *X*


* How long should this assignment take?

    * This will depend heavily on experience levels
    * At this stage, expect the assignments to take multiple hours
    * In other words, do not get discouraged if you are on hour 4 and you've yet to finish
    * Remember, you would not expect to write a high quality essay in a single one hour sitting


* I think I did everything correctly, but it's still not working

    * This is typical
    * Sometimes bugs are simple and easy to find, and others are sneaky
    * Take your time with debugging and tracking down the problem
    * I recommend going through the code; what does the code you wrote actually say?
    * If you are still stuck after an hour or so of trying to get the broken part working, come to office hours


* What do the provided functions do?

    * Have a read of the docstrings for the functions
    * Trying to figure out their functionality is part of the assignment
    * Learning to look at unfamiliar code is a critically important skill to learn


* Some of the code in the provided functions looks like magic

    * This is normal, even with experienced programmers
    * It would be unusual if one were to look at a non-trivial block of code and immediately know what it is doing
    * At this stage, you may need to do a bit of googling to make sense of the code
    * This is an important skill to develop


* Is it OK to solve the problems in a way you did not describe, since I believe my solution is better

    * It may be the case that you truly found a better way to solve the problem, but follow the provided instructions
    * Sometimes constraints are provided to you to emphasize a specific skill you are to learn and develop
    * Additionally, if you do not follow the instructions, it may break the automated testing of your code


* How do I know if I have enough comments?

    * You don't really
    * Write your docstrings
    * If you have a block of code that you feel is not self-explanatory, consider adding a comment
    * Do not get carried away with adding comments
    * If possible, make the code itself as self-explanatory as possible, that way you don't need the comment


* Can I work with a friend?

    * No
    * This can be a little tricky to navigate since high-level discussions among students about ideas is fine

        * But sitting down and working together is not

    * Additionally, using Google to help find answers to your questions is encouraged

        * But finding a solution and copying it is not

    * You have been taught how to not cheat when you were younger --- use your best judgement


* If the deadline is 11:55pm and I submit it shortly after that, will it still get marked?

    * No
    * It would be unfair to not be consistent and follow the outline set at the start of the semester
    * To hedge against a late submission, aim to submit the assignment well before the deadline


* I accidentally submitted the wrong code --- will you accept the correct code even though it's late?

    * No
    * Unfortunately this is a common cheating strategy students take in order to submit their assignments late
    * Although you may have truly made this mistake, because cheating is so rampant, I cannot accept these submissions


* Will I really get a 0 if the submission is done incorrectly?

    * Yes
    * Unfortunately, like submitting the wrong code, this is a common cheating strategy
