Before Kattis
=============

We're going to do a bunch of linear searchers to start. 

**1**

Write a function ``char_is_in_while(char,string)`` that returns True if the character char appears in the string ``string``. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 

**2**

Write a function ``char_is_in_for(char,string)`` that returns True if the character char appears in the string ``string``. This function **must** use a *for* loop. 

**3**

Write a function ``where_is_while(char,string)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``char`` in ``string``. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 


**4**

Write a function ``where_is_for(char,string)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``char`` in ``string``. This function **must** use a *for* loop.


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.

   If you get really stuck on any question, move on to the next one! Do not get bogged down.

If you finish this lab, go check out `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/>`_. Sort the problems by *Acceptance* (click the table header) and start seeing if you can solve some of these problems. 

**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**

.. warning::
   
    If you are in the online section, you **must** submit the .py (python scripts), not the .ipynb (notebook files). To get the python scripts from Colab, simply select *File* and in te dropdown menue, hit *Download .py*.
