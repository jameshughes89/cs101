Loops

* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Pre Lab Exercises
=================

#. `Chapter 7 exercise(s) <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/iteration.html#exercises>`_

    * 9 `What is a "triangle number"? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number>`_ (no ``assert`` test for this)
    * 14 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function)
    * 15 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function) --- not required, but recommended


#. Write assertion tests for each of your functions above, except for exercise 9, since it requires ``print``



Before Kattis
=============

#. Write a function ``count_to_n_while(n: int):`` to print out each number from :math:`0` -- :math:`(n - 1)`

    * This function must use a ``while`` loop
    * This function will not return anything


#. Write a function ``count_to_n_for(n: int):`` to print out each number from :math:`0` -- :math:`(n - 1)`

    * This function must use a ``for`` loop
    * This function will not return anything



Kattis Problems
===============

* You should be using a scrap piece of paper to work out the ideas for the following problems

    * The problems you are to solve are getting too complex to try to solve by just coding
    * Trying to solve problems by just typing away will not yield success
