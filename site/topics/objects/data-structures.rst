******************************
Objects IV --- Data Structures
******************************

* We have spent much of the course learning how to write algorithms
* But we also saw a few data structures

    * Lists
    * Tuples
    * Sets
    * Dictionaries

* Although these data structures had clear functionality associated with them, we use them as a mechanism for storing and managing data
* They may also provide some other benefits

    * Ability to index
    * Efficient lookups
    * Easy to search
    * Ordering the data
    * Managing duplicates
    * ...

* Consider the ``List``\s we have been using

    * They can be indexed
    * The lists have a beginning and end
    * The elements exist in some order (though, not necessarily *ordered*)
    * They are easy to do a linear search on

* You have all been taking advantage of these features, but the lists are provided to us at a certain level of abstraction
* If you dig deeper and look under the hood, all the functionality of the list needs to be programmed

* Data structures are an important part of a programmers toolbox
* Actually understanding *how* they do what they do is critical
* To start learning about data structures, we will be constructing our own simple collection --- a ``Course`` that will manage ``Student`` objects
