Before Kattis
=============

#. Write a function ``character_is_in_while(needle: str, haystack:str) -> bool:``

    * The function will ``return`` ``True`` if ``needle`` exists within ``haystack`` and ``False`` otherwise
    * This function must use a ``while`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_in_for(needle: str, haystack:str) -> bool:``

    * The function will ``return`` ``True`` if ``needle`` exists within ``haystack`` and ``False`` otherwise
    * This function must use a ``for`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_at_while(needle: str, haystack:str) -> int:``

    * The function will ``return`` the index of the first occurrence of ``needle`` within ``haystack`` and ``-1`` if it is not found
    * This function must use a ``while`` loop

#. Write a function ``character_is_at_for(needle: str, haystack:str) -> int:``

    * The function will ``return`` the index of the first occurrence of ``needle`` within ``haystack`` and ``-1`` if it is not found
    * This function must use a ``for`` loop


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.
