Some Sorting
************

.. Warning::

    We are into the domain of *nontrivial* algorithms. You should **not** expect to look at these algorithms and immediately understand how they work. (In fact, if you can do that, you should immediately enroll in grad school in Computer Science). These algorithms require *careful study* to make sense of. The best tool you have for understanding how they work is to *carefully trace their operation, step by step*. Trying to understand complex algorithms "all in one go" is a recipe for frustration. Take your time, and step through the algorithm (with pen and paper) on a small input to get a feel for what it's doing. I know you know about the debugger, but pen and paper is still #1. 
   
Sorting
=======

* Believe it or not, there are a *lot* of ways to sort a list!
* Some algorithms are just plain bad.
* Some are usually pretty good.
* There is no *best* algorithm for *any* list. Just trade offs.
* We're going to look at a few simple sorting algorithms now.

    1. Have you ever sorted things in your life?
    2. Take 2 mins to talk amongst yourselves about the *algorithm* you used to sort the things. 
    3. What did you do?

.. Warning::

    Each of the following algorithms have many implementations. What makes the algorithm the algorithm is the *high-level* idea, not the actual, literal implementations.
   
Insertion sort
==============

	.. image:: insertion.gif

* You give me a list called ``in_list``
* I create a new, empty, list called ``sorted_list``
* For each element in ``in_list``
    * I *insert* that element into ``sorted_list`` in the correct spot.
    * e.g., if I'm asked to insert ``5`` into the list ``[1,3,7]``, I should end up with: ``[1,3,5,7]``

.. admonition:: Activity

    Do an insertion sort, with pencil and paper, on the list ``[3,7,15,9,4,11,1,5,2]``. Record the value of ``sorted_list`` at each step.   
   
Let's have a look at an insertion sort implementation in Python::

    def insertion_sort(in_list):
        sorted_list = []
        for element in in_list:
            i = 0
            while i < len(sorted_list) and (element > sorted_list[i]):
                i = i + 1
            sorted_list.insert(i, element)
        return sorted_list

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Modify the ``insertion_sort()`` function above so that it prints out the value of ``sorted_list`` after each iteration of the `for` loop. Try sorting a few lists and following the output. Does it make sense to you?

* Now that we've got the idea down, let's be computer science nerds about it.

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    * How many times do I go around the `for` loop in ``insertion_sort()`` ? On each trip through the `for` loop, I also have to go through the inner `while` loop.
        * How many times do I go through the `while` loop, on average?
        * In the worst case?
	  
    * Is Insertion sort the best possible sort? Can we do better?

Selection Sort
==============

	.. image:: selection.gif

* You give me a list called ``in_list``
* I scan through the whole list to find the smallest element
* I swap the smallest element with the first element in the list
* I repeat the above process for the remainder of the list (excluding the first element)
* Lather, rinse, repeat.

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Do a selection sort, with pencil and paper, on the list ``[3,7,15,9,4,11,1,5,2]``. Record the value of your list at each step.  

* Different idea than Insertion sort, but still gets the job done!
* This is a very important thing to understand:
    * *Sorting* is a *problem*, not an algorithm
    * There are (infinitely) *many* algorithms to solve any (solvable) problem
    * Some algorithms will always solve the problem more efficiently than others
    * Some will solve the problem more efficiently only for certain conditions
    * For some problems we can *prove* that a particular algorithm is the best (in the sense that any other algorithm can, at best, be equally efficient)
    * For many problems, we *still don't know* how to do this!
   
* Fortunately, for sorting we *do* know how to do this analysis... and both Insertion Sort and Selection Sort suck.
 
Let's see Selection sort in action::

    def selection_sort(in_list):
        for i in range(len(in_list)):
      
            # Find the smallest remaining element
            min_index = i
            min_val = in_list[i]
            for j in range(i+1,len(in_list)):
                if in_list[j] < min_val:
                    min_val = in_list[j]
                    min_index = j
                   
            # Swap it to the left side of the list
            in_list[min_index] = in_list[i]
            in_list[i] = min_val
         
        return in_list

    Modify the ``selection_sort()`` function above so that it prints out the value of ``in_list`` after each iteration of the outer `for` loop. Try sorting a few lists and following the output.

Bubble Sort
===========

	.. image:: bubble.gif

* Maybe you find Insertion sort or Selection sort ugly or offensive?
* No problem. Remember: there are *many* algorithms to solve any one problem.
* You give me a list called ``in_list``
* I scan through the list, looking at adjacent pairs of values.
* If I see a pair that is "out of order" (e.g., ``[17, 9]`` ), I swap the two values to be in order ( ``[9,17]`` ).
* I keep doing that until the list is sorted.

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Do a bubble sort, with pencil and paper, on the list ``[3,7,15,9,4,11,1,5,2]``. Record the value of your list at each step.  

* It's called "bubble sort" because the smaller values seem to "bubble up to the top".
* Kinda cool because:
    * We end up effecting a *global* change on the list (it goes from unsorted to sorted)...
    * ... but we only use *local* information about the elements (we only ever compare neighbours in the list)
   
Let's see Bubble sort in Python::

    def bubble_sort(in_list):
        swapped_something = True
        while swapped_something:
            swapped_something = False
         
            for i in range(len(in_list)-1):
                if in_list[i] > in_list[i+1]:
                    tmp = in_list[i]
                    in_list[i]=in_list[i+1]
                    in_list[i+1]=tmp
                    swapped_something = True
        return in_list

* Ugh... Wouldn't the above code be better if there were comments?

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Modify the ``bubble_sort()`` function above so that it prints out the value of ``in_list`` after each iteration of the outer `while` loop. Try sorting a few lists and following the output.

    How many times do I go around the outer `while` loop ? How
    about the inner `for` loop?

Bogosort
========

Here's another attempt at a sorting algorithm::

    import random
   
    def is_sorted(in_list):
        last = in_list[0]
        for element in in_list[1:]:
            if last > element:
                return False
            last = element
        return True
     
     
    def bogo_sort(in_list):
        while not is_sorted(in_list):
            random.shuffle(in_list)

        return in_list

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    How does this sorting algorithm work? We're "working backwards" this time. Starting from the code, come up with an English explanation for how the algorithm works. You might want to add a ``print`` statement after the ``random.shuffle(in_list)`` line to get some intuition. If you aren't sure what ``random.shuffle()`` does... look it up, or just *try* it on some sample lists. Likewise, you'll have to figure out what ``is_sorted()`` is doing (though the name should help). 
   
.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity
   
    Is this a good sorting algorithm? How many times do I have to go through the ``while`` loop in ``bogo_sort``? How about the ``for`` loop in ``is_sorted()``?

WTF!?
=====

* Searching a list is *way* faster when we have a sorted list. 
* Why would someone want to sort a list in order to search it slightly faster when sorting is so slow?
* Well, we might want to search the same list many times.
    * We only need to sort it once.
* We might want to sort something without the end goal of searching.
* BUT, also, there are better sorting algorithms...

Why are we doing this again?
============================

* In your day-to-day life as a programmer, you won't write your own sorting routines. You'll rely on routines written by others, like Python's built-in ``sort()`` (which, by the way, uses the `Timsort algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ )
* BUT... even if you don't build the tools yourself, you should understand how they work
* More importantly: you **WILL** need to develop your own algorithms for some task that is much less well-studied than sorting.
* You're learning fundamentals of algorithm development here... not just the details of sorting.
* Let me say that again... **THE POINT OF THIS IS TO LEARN THE ALGORITHM FUNDAMENTALS**



The horrible truth
==================

* Insertion, Selection, and Bubble sort generally suck as sorting algorithms.
* BUT... they are within our current means.
* Once we've studied *recursion*, we will revisit sorting and see two *very good* sorting algorithms (Quicksort and Mergesort).
* If you want to geek out on sorting *right now*:
    * `The relevant Wikipedia page is very good <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm>`_
    * Knuth's `The Art of Computer Programming Volume 3: Sorting and Searching <http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Volume-Searching/dp/0201896850>`_ .
        * It would be nearly impossible to overstate the importance of Donald Knuth's contributions to Computer Science.
