Before Kattis
=============

**1**

Write a *function* called ``count_to_n_w(n)`` to print a count from 0 to ``n-1``. This function should use a *while* loop. 


**2**

Write a function called ``add_one_n_times_w(a, n)`` that will add **one** to a number ``a`` a total of ``n`` times. In the end, have this function ``return`` the value. This function **must** use a ``while`` loop. It should work such that:

>>> ans = add_one_n_times(7, 5)
>>> print(ans)
12

**3**

Write a *function* called ``count_to_n_f(n)`` to print a count from 0 to ``n-1``. This function should use a *for* loop. **Hint:** `check out range. <https://www.google.ca/search?q=python+range+for+loop&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA808CA808&oq=python+range+for+loop&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2437j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>`_

**4**

Write another function called ``add_one_n_times_f(a, n)`` that will add **one** to a number ``a`` a total of ``n`` times, but this time with a ``for`` loop. 


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.
