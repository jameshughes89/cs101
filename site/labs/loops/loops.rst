* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* Ensure I have recorded your completion --- failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab

    * When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

.. note::

    To obtain full marks for the lab, you must:

        #. Have completed the pre-lab exercises
        #. Have been working on the lab content
        #. Demonstrate competency in the topics


Pre Lab Exercises
=================

.. warning::

    You must have completed the specified exercises prior to the start of the lab. If you have not come to lab prepared,
    you will be asked to leave and you will obtain a grade of 0 for the lab.

#. `Chapter 7 exercise(s) <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/iteration.html#exercises>`_

    * 8
    * 9
    * 14 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function)
    * 15 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function)


Before Kattis
=============

#. Write a function ``count_to_n_while(n: int):`` to print out each number from :math:`0 -- (n - 1)`

    * This function must use a ``while`` loop
    * This function will not return anything

#. Write a function ``count_to_n_for(n: int):`` to print out each number from :math:`0 -- (n - 1)`

    * This function must use a ``for`` loop
    * This function will not return anything


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.

6. https://open.kattis.com/problems/datum (more annoying than tough)
7. https://open.kattis.com/problems/dicecup (tough -- grab that paper)


**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**
