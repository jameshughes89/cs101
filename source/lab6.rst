Before Kattis
=============

We're going to do a bunch of linear searchers to start. 

**1**

Write a function ``char_is_in_while(character, phrase)`` that returns ``True`` if the letter ``character`` appears in the string ``phrase``, otherwise return ``False``. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 

**2**

Write a function ``char_is_in_for(character, phrase)`` that returns ``True`` if the letter ``character`` appears in the string ``phrase``, otherwise return ``False``. This function **must** use a *for* loop. 

**3**

Write a function ``where_is_while(character, phrase)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``character`` in ``phrase``. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 


**4**

Write a function ``where_is_for(character, phrase)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``character`` in ``phrase``. This function **must** use a *for* loop.


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.
