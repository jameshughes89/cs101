******************************
Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
******************************

* In addition to lists, there are a few other noteworthy datastructures we will look at in this course
* Although they will not be used as much as lists, it's important to be aware of the tools you have at your disposal


Tuples
======

* A tuple looks and behaves similar to a list, but has slightly different syntax

    * Tuples use parentheses ``(``\, ``)``

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        some_tuple = (10, 11)
        print(some_tuple)   # Results in (10, 11)


* They are both ordered sequences of data
* They can be indexed like lists

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        some_tuple = (10, 11)
        print(some_tuple[0])   # Results in 10


* But unlike lists, tuples are immutable

    * Once they are created, we cannot change them

* They're ideal for when we need to pack some data together

    * For example, a tuple would be great for storing cartesian coordinate ``(x, y)``
    * Tuples were also used in the Starbucks assignment to store the latitude and longitude pairs

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        for row in starbucks_file_reader:
            location_tuple = (float(row[0]), float(row[1]))
            starbucks_locations.append(location_tuple)


Dictionaries
============

* Dictionaries are amazing data structures that are a little more complex than lists and tuples

    * Much of their complexity is hidden from us so we will not worry about it here

* Simply, they are like list that you could index with *strings*, or various other types, instead of just integers
* Consider the following example of storing grades for students

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Create a new, empty dictionary
    some_dictionary = {}

    # Add a few things to the dictionary
    some_dictionary["Billy"] = 74
    some_dictionary["Sally"] = 88
    some_dictionary["Jimmy-Bob"] = 99

    # Print out the dictionary
    print(some_dictionary)      # Results in {'Billy': 74, 'Sally': 88, 'Jimmy-Bob': 99}


* In the example, a dictionary was created and three values were added to the dictionary
* But values are associated with unique *keys*

    * The keys must be unique, but the values do not need to be

* The keys in the example are ``"Billy"``, ``"Sally"``, and ``"Jimmy-Bob"``
* Each of the keys have an associated value --- ``74``, ``88``, and ``99`` respectively

* Accessing a value from a specific key from the dictionary is done with indexing

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print(some_dictionary["Jimmy-Bob"])     # Results in 99
    print(some_dictionary["Sally"])         # Results in 88


* And updating a value associated with a key is done just like the original assignment

    * Keys are unique, so using an existing key would overwrite the value and not make a new entry

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    some_dictionary["Sally"] = 90
    print(some_dictionary["Sally"])         # Results in 90


Why They Are Great
------------------

* Instead of using a dictionary to store the grades, imagine using a 2D list


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    my_grades = []
    my_grades.append(["Billy", 74])
    my_grades.append(["Sally", 88])
    my_grades.append(["Jimmy-Bob", 99])
    print(my_grades)                        # Results in [['Billy', 74], ['Sally', 88], ['Jimmy-Bob', 99]]


* How would I obtain the grade for a specific student?

    * I would need to do a linear search for the student's name before I could access the grade
    * Assuming I have some ``linear_search`` function

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        the_student = linear_search(my_grades, "Sally")
        grade = the_student[1]
        print(grade)                        # Results in 88


* Alternatively, with a dictionary, it's much simpler --- just index the dictionary on the student's name

    * Assuming ``my_grades`` was a dictionary like ``some_dictionary`` instead of a list of lists

        .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        grade = my_grades["Sally"]
        print(grade)                        # Results in 88


* In addition to being simpler syntax, the dictionary eliminates the need for the linear search

    * Remember, the amount of work needed for a linear search grows as the number in the collection grows
    * If we don't need to do the linear search, we eliminate all that extra work


.. note::

    Remember how the ``sum`` function still requires the computer to look at each value in a list, but that
    functionality was hidden from us. Dictionaries are **not** simply hiding the linear search from us; its actual
    underlying functionality does not need to do a linear search (although, there are some exceptions to this).

    We will not be going into more details on how dictionaries work in this course, but that does not stop us from
    using and taking advantage of the dictionary's benefits.


Sets
====

* A set is kinda' like a list, but it only holds *unique* things.
* Also, sets typically do not have any ordering to them.
    * Lists start at index 0, then go to 1, 2, ... 
    * Sets start... wherever
   
    >>> a = set([])	# `[]' not actually needed for empty one
    >>> print(a)
    set()
    
    >>> print(type(a))
    <class 'set'>
    
    >>> b = set([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>>print(b)   
    {1, 2, 3, 4}

* Cool. But you said something about *uniqueness* and *orderdness*

    >>> c = set([3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5])
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   
* Hmmm... Looks ordered to me
    * Not really though, there is no actual intrinsic ordering enforced here
* We can totally see the uniqueness though, so that's cool

* ``in`` totally works

    >>> print(3 in c)
    True
    
    >>> print('a' in c)
    False
   
* Iterating over a set

    >>> for thing in c:
    >>>   print(thing)
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
   
* Add things to a set

    >>> c.add('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello'}
    
    >>> c.add('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello'}
   
* *discard* things
 
    >>> c.discard('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    >>> c.discard('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   
* *remove* things
    * Almost the same as discard, but will throw an *exception* if we try to remove something that's not there
   
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    >>> c.remove(5)
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4}
   
    >>> c.remove(5)
    KeyError              Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-91-0733df1dbd33> in <module>()
    ----> 1 c.remove(5)
    KeyError: 5

* Clearing out a set

    >>> c.clear()
    >>> print(c)
    set()

* Check equality

    >>> c = set([1, 2, 3])
    >>> d = set([3, 2, 1])
    >>> print(c == d)
    True
   
What makes them special other than just uniqueness and orderdness?
------------------------------------------------------------------

* So far they might not seem that special when compared to lists
* But they are very very very special in many ways
* One of which is: ``in``. 
* Remember how when we used ``in`` for a list, but at the end of the day, the computer still have to do a linear search
    * Remember what a liner search is?
* Turns out, for a set, ``in`` can tell us if something is in the set **without** having to do a linear search!

    Load up this code into Python:
   
    .. code-block:: python
   
        set_a = set([0, 1])
        set_b = set([0, 1, 2])
        set_c = set([2, 3])

    * Figure out if there is an easy way to determine if set ``set_a`` ``isubset`` of ``set_b``
    * Figure out if thre is an easy way to get the ``union`` of two sets
    * Figure out if there is an easy way to get the ``intersection`` of two sets
    * Figure out if there is an easy way to get the ``difference`` between ``set_b`` and ``set_a`` 
    * Do the previous one again but try the ``difference`` between ``set_a`` and ``set_b``
   
    **HINT:** hit tab.

    1. Imagine I gave you the text from a book that you could load up into Python. What's the easiest way to count the number of unique words?
   
    2. What would you do if I gave you another book and asked you which words do they have in common?
   
    3. What if I wanted to know the number of unique words that exist between the two books?
   
    4. What If I wanted to know which words were in one book, but not the other?


The Bad News...
===============

* The above data structures are pretty awesome
* Unfortunately... they're not *free*
    * Although Python really makes it look like they are
* With dictionaries, sets, tuples, and even lists, someone actually had to write a lot of nifty algorithms to do all the amazing things they do
* I briefly discussed fixed length arrays before, and those, classically speaking, we get for free, in addition to the *primitive types*
* Most of the cool data structures we've seen so far are actually built on top of the fixed length arrays
* In the same way that we're not actually sure how ``print`` actually works, we don't know how these data structures really work under the hood. 


The Good News...
================

* This does not really matter for us right now. 
* As of now, we don't really need to know all this to get the computer to do fun things. 
* Just like how you don't really need to know all the ins and outs of an internal combustion engine in order to drive a car, we don't need to know all the ins and outs of the data structures to use them. 
* Buuuuutttttttttttt... at the same time, if I was a race car driver, maybe knowing how things work under the hood could help me tweak and tune the car for the best performance. 

The Good/Bad News...
====================

* The under the hood stuff here is outside the scope of this course. 
* If you're thinking **Thank F@-%!#& GAWD**, lucky you
* If you're thinking *awhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I wanna' know*, sorry

* Either way, we will look at *some* of these data structures in CSCI 162!
    * Trust me, it's actually a lot of fun!!
