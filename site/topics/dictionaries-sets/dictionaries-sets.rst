******************************
Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
******************************

* In addition to lists, there are a few other noteworthy datastructures we will look at in this course
* Although they will not be used as much as lists, it's important to be aware of the tools you have at your disposal


Tuples
======

* A tuple looks and behaves similar to a list, but has slightly different syntax

    * Tuples use parentheses ``(``\, ``)``)

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        some_tuple = (10, 11)
        print(some_tuple)   # Results in (10, 11)


* They are both ordered sequences of data
* They can be indexed like lists

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        some_tuple = (10, 11)
        print(some_tuple[0])   # Results in 10


* But unlike lists, tuples are immutable

    * Once they are created, we cannot change them

* They're ideal for when we need to pack some data together

    * For example, a tuple would be great for storing cartesian coordinate ``(x, y)``
    * Tuples were also used in the Starbucks assignment to store the latitude and longitude pairs

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        for row in starbucks_file_reader:
            location_tuple = (float(row[0]), float(row[1]))
            starbucks_locations.append(location_tuple)


Dictionaries
============
* Python Dictionaries are a more complex data structure than what we've seen so far.
* But... they are *very very very very very very very very useful*.
* Imagine a list which you can index with *strings* instead of *numbers*.
* That's a dictionary.
* Let's create an empty dictionary:

    >>> my_dict = {}

* Looks like an empty list, but using ``{}`` instead of ``[]``.
* How do I add something?

    >>> my_dict['James']=50
    >>> print(my_dict)
    {'James': 50}

* The dictionary has associated the *key* ``James`` with the *value* ``50``.
* Maybe this is a dictionary of grades? I need to work harder.
* Let's add more:

    >>> my_dict['Suzy'] = 95
    >>> my_dict['Johnny'] = 85
    >>> print(my_dict)
    {'James': 50, 'Suzy': 95, 'Johnny': 85}

* Dictionaries always associate a *key* with a *value*.
    * ``dict[key] = value``
   
.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Build the dictionary ``my_dict`` above. 
   
    Figure out how to access the value associated with a particular key, without printing out the whole dictionary (e.g., how would I print just Suzy's grade?). 

    *Hint*: it's a lot like indexing a list or array or tuple...
   
    What happens if I try to index the dictionary with a key that doesn't exist?
   
* Dictionaries are a *generalization* of lists:
    * A list associates *fixed indices* from 0 up to ``n`` with values.
    * A dictionary associates *arbitrary strings* with values.

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Now type ``my_dict.`` and hit the [Tab] key. Play around with the built-in functions for dictionaries. 

    Take special care to look at: 

        * ``my_dict.keys()``
        * ``my_dict.values()``

    I wonder if there is an easy way to iterate over the contents of a dictionary?
   
   
* This is *really useful* for humans because it's much easier for us to assign names to things than to try to remember arbitrary numberings.
  
* Many programming languages have nothing like dictionaries. In some others you'll see them called "associative arrays" or "associative memories".
    * In some, we have to *make* them ourselves

* We've just scratched the surface of what you can do with dictionaries here, but it's enough for our purposes right now.

So Why Are They Great?
----------------------

* Imagine we have a 2D list like this:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    # Creates some lookup table list thing
    grades = [['James', 98], ['Bob', 86], ['Janice', 86], ['Greg', 59]]

* How would we get the grade for any given student?
    * Linear search, right!
    * So there is nothing *wrong* with this, but... there's a better way!

* With a dictionary, we can simply do this!

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    # Creates some lookup table list thing
    grades = {'James':98, 'Bob':86, 'Janice':86, 'Greg':59}

* How would we get the grade for any given student?
    * Just index the dictionary!
    * Way better!

Are They Actually Better?
-------------------------

* Remember how the ``in`` keyword allowed us to do a linear search really easily. 
* It wasn't really *better* than coding a linear search yourself, but it did save some typing. 
* Is the dictionary not just doing the linear search work for us like how ``in`` was?
    * **NO** (asterisk) 
    * But I won't teach you this yet because it's well beyond the scope of this class. 
        * Sorry :(   
   
.. admonition:: `Activity++ <https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/>`_

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
   
    **EXAMPLE**

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,

    return [0, 1].

Sets
====

* A set is kinda' like a list, but it only holds *unique* things.
* Also, sets typically do not have any ordering to them.
    * Lists start at index 0, then go to 1, 2, ... 
    * Sets start... wherever
   
    >>> a = set([])	# `[]' not actually needed for empty one
    >>> print(a)
    set()
    
    >>> print(type(a))
    <class 'set'>
    
    >>> b = set([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>>print(b)   
    {1, 2, 3, 4}

* Cool. But you said something about *uniqueness* and *orderdness*

    >>> c = set([3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5])
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   
* Hmmm... Looks ordered to me
    * Not really though, there is no actual intrinsic ordering enforced here
* We can totally see the uniqueness though, so that's cool

* ``in`` totally works

    >>> print(3 in c)
    True
    
    >>> print('a' in c)
    False
   
* Iterating over a set

    >>> for thing in c:
    >>>   print(thing)
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
   
* Add things to a set

    >>> c.add('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello'}
    
    >>> c.add('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello'}
   
* *discard* things
 
    >>> c.discard('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    >>> c.discard('hello')
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   
* *remove* things
    * Almost the same as discard, but will throw an *exception* if we try to remove something that's not there
   
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    >>> c.remove(5)
    >>> print(c)
    {1, 2, 3, 4}
   
    >>> c.remove(5)
    KeyError              Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-91-0733df1dbd33> in <module>()
    ----> 1 c.remove(5)
    KeyError: 5

* Clearing out a set

    >>> c.clear()
    >>> print(c)
    set()

* Check equality

    >>> c = set([1, 2, 3])
    >>> d = set([3, 2, 1])
    >>> print(c == d)
    True
   
What makes them special other than just uniqueness and orderdness?
------------------------------------------------------------------

* So far they might not seem that special when compared to lists
* But they are very very very special in many ways
* One of which is: ``in``. 
* Remember how when we used ``in`` for a list, but at the end of the day, the computer still have to do a linear search
    * Remember what a liner search is?
* Turns out, for a set, ``in`` can tell us if something is in the set **without** having to do a linear search!

    Load up this code into Python:
   
    .. code-block:: python
   
        set_a = set([0, 1])
        set_b = set([0, 1, 2])
        set_c = set([2, 3])

    * Figure out if there is an easy way to determine if set ``set_a`` ``isubset`` of ``set_b``
    * Figure out if thre is an easy way to get the ``union`` of two sets
    * Figure out if there is an easy way to get the ``intersection`` of two sets
    * Figure out if there is an easy way to get the ``difference`` between ``set_b`` and ``set_a`` 
    * Do the previous one again but try the ``difference`` between ``set_a`` and ``set_b``

    1. Imagine I gave you the text from a book that you could load up into Python. What's the easiest way to count the number of unique words?
   
    2. What would you do if I gave you another book and asked you which words do they have in common?
   
    3. What if I wanted to know the number of unique words that exist between the two books?
   
    4. What If I wanted to know which words were in one book, but not the other?


The Bad News...
===============

* The above data structures are pretty awesome
* Unfortunately... they're not *free*
    * Although Python really makes it look like they are
* With dictionaries, sets, tuples, and even lists, someone actually had to write a lot of nifty algorithms to do all the amazing things they do
* I briefly discussed fixed length arrays before, and those, classically speaking, we get for free, in addition to the *primitive types*
* Most of the cool data structures we've seen so far are actually built on top of the fixed length arrays
* In the same way that we're not actually sure how ``print`` actually works, we don't know how these data structures really work under the hood. 


The Good News...
================

* This does not really matter for us right now. 
* As of now, we don't really need to know all this to get the computer to do fun things. 
* Just like how you don't really need to know all the ins and outs of an internal combustion engine in order to drive a car, we don't need to know all the ins and outs of the data structures to use them. 
* Buuuuutttttttttttt... at the same time, if I was a race car driver, maybe knowing how things work under the hood could help me tweak and tune the car for the best performance. 

The Good/Bad News...
====================

* The under the hood stuff here is outside the scope of this course. 
* If you're thinking **Thank F@-%!#& GAWD**, lucky you
* If you're thinking *awhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I wanna' know*, sorry

* Either way, we will look at *some* of these data structures in CSCI 162!
    * Trust me, it's actually a lot of fun!!
