***********************************
Objects III --- Interacting Objects
***********************************

* We completed the ``Sphere`` class in the previous topic, and it will work for our needs
* However, there are a few things we could do to improve the design and implementation
* One idea is to make a ``Point3D`` class to manage all the point related things

    * Location in three dimensional space
    * Distance between points
    * Equality on points

* Although there is nothing wrong with the original ``Sphere`` implementation, let's consider that

    * It will make our ``Sphere`` class simpler and easier to understand
    * It allows us to write the methods at a higher-level of abstraction since can deal with ``Point3D`` objects instead of individual coordinates
    * If we wanted to make other three dimensional shapes, they could use something like a ``Point3D`` class to represent their position
    * It allows us to abstract and delegate some functionality to another class
    * It will help with testing since we can test the ``Point3D`` class' functionality and the ``Sphere``\s independently
