Introduction and Output
***********************

What Will I Learn?
==================

* The short version

    * How to write computer programs
    * How to write programs to solve problems
    * A little bit of how computers work
    * A little bit about what on earth computer science is

* The long version:

    * :doc:`Read the outline </outline/outline>`

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Where have you encountered computer programs before?

    Can anyone name an area of Science where they think having computer programming skill would be a bad thing? How
    about Social Science? Humanities? Art? Talk with your neighbours.


What Prerequisites Do I Need?
=============================

* Curiosity


Why Are The Course Notes A Website?
===================================

* You're going to learn to write programs in Python
* Most Python documentation is made with something called Sphinx
* These course notes are made with Sphinx
* The idea: get used to reading and learning from something in this format

    * `Here's an example <https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html>`_



How Will This Class Work?
=========================

* This class is going to be run somewhat differently from other courses you may have experienced at university 
* I have a number of activities throughout the topics that we will take time to work on

    * They also help with breaking up the monotony of listening to a lecture for an hour straight

* At the end of each topic there are linked suggested readings you should work through to get practice

    * The only way to learn this stuff is through practice
    * You can watch every YouTube video on how to play piano that exists, but you still won't know how to play piano unless you practice


.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Have a chat with the people sitting around you: 

    * What are their majors?    
    * Why did you come to StFX?
    * Why are they taking this class?   
    * What do you hope to learn? 
    * How do you think you will use what you learn in the future?
   
   
What Should I Bring To Class
============================

* Curiosity
* Readiness to do stuff, rather than just listen
* A laptop and/or pen and paper

    * Taking notes is still important even though the content is online
    * If you can bring a laptop, I strongly recommend it as there will be opportunity for you to program during activities


Is This Class Easy?
===================

The quick answer is, it depends...

.. admonition:: Quick Activity
    :class: activity

    * Who here knows how to use a hammer?
    * Who knows how to use a screwdriver?
    * Who knows how to use a saw?
    * ...
    * ...
    * Who here knows how to build a house?


* Each of the things you will learn are perhaps simple on their own, but using them together to achieve something is challenging
* These topics really are going to be shockingly different from what you are probably used to

    * Very few classes can prepare you for the way of thinking that will be required for this class

* Unfortunately, intro to computer science classes do often have an unusually high fail rate
* The best way to set yourself up for success is

    * Practice
    * Read
    * Stay on top of the content


So I Should Be Terrified?
=========================

* No
* It's entirely doable **if you put in the effort**
* Warning though --- the class is dense and very accumulative, do not fall behind

* The good news is, you get to make mistakes

    * In fact, expect to make **a lot** of mistakes

* You get to see if what you did works or not
* Most of this class will be you beating your head against your keyboard until you get it right
* Not many classes or disciplines give you this luxury

* I really can't stress this enough

    * Most of the time when you're *working* on the course material you will be getting things wrong
    * The majority of programming is actually *debugging*
    * Get used to making mistakes

        * This is a good thing
        * This is normal


I Need Help!
============

* Knowing the challenges students face, we have provided many resources to help you succeed

    * `Google <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C_cgL2150>`_
    * YouTube videos
    * Email
    * `Google <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C_cgL2150>`_
    * Office hours
    * `Google <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C_cgL2150>`_
    * Labs
    * `Google <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C_cgL2150>`_


Google?
-------

* When a programmer isn't debugging, they're Googling their problems

    * This is so common that it's a meme

* I am going to tell you to "Google It" very often in this course

    * This is intentional

* Independent learning is one of the most important things you will learn
* Further, it will be your go to tool when you're programming in the future 
* `Get used to "Googling it" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C_cgL2150>`_


Can I Write A Program Now?
==========================

* If you have gone through :doc:`get set up for CSCI 161 </getting-set/getting-set>`, then yes
* Go to `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_ and make your "Hello, world!" program

    * `"Hello, world!" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program>`_ is traditionally the first program one writes in a new language

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print("Hello, world!")


.. image:: HelloWorldColab.png

* You're now officially a computer programmer

.. warning::

    We must turn off the generative AI feature within Google Colab to help ensure your success. The use of the
    generative AI feature within Colab will be a problem for this course for two major reasons. The first is that it
    tries to help programmers write the code that you are to learn in this course, thereby eliminating your ability to
    learn the content. The second reason is that it is often incorrect, which is a nightmare for new programmers.

    To turn this feature off, select "Tools" on the top menu, then select "Settings".

    .. image:: tools_settings.png

    Within the settings window, select the "AI Assistance" option on the left, then uncheck "Consented to use generative
    AI features" and check "Hide generative AI features".

For Next Class
==============

* If you have not yet, :doc:`go through set up for CS 161 </getting-set/getting-set>`
* `Read Chapter 1 of the text <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/way_of_the_program.html>`_
* `Read Sections 2.1-2.5 of Chapter 2 of the text <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/variables_expressions_statements.html>`_
