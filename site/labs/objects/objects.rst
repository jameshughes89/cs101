* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Pre Lab Exercises
=================

* Have a working implementation of the ``Circle`` class from :doc:`lecture </topics/objects/introduction>`

    * You can obtain the source code from :download:`here <../../../src/circle.py>`
    * It will provide a nice template for all the classes you will make in this lab



Before Kattis
=============

#. Create a ``Square`` class

    * Single attribute ``side_length``
    * The constructor will take a parameter for specifying the size
    * Method for calculating ``area()``
    * Method for calculating the ``perimeter()``
    * Make instances of the class and write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness


#. Create a ``Rectangle`` class

    * Attribute for ``length``
    * Another attribute for ``width``
    * The constructor will take two parameters for specifying the size
    * Method for calculating ``area()``
    * Method for calculating the ``perimeter()``
    * Make instances of the class and write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness


#. Create a ``RectangularPrism`` class

    * Attributes for ``length``, ``width``, and ``height``
    * The constructor will take three parameters for specifying the size
    * A method for calculating ``surface_area()``
    * A method for calculating ``volume()``
    * Make instances of the class and write ``assert`` tests to verify correctness



Kattis Problems
===============

* You should be using a scrap piece of paper to work out the ideas for the following problems

    * The problems you are to solve are getting too complex to try to solve by just coding
    * Trying to solve problems by just typing away will not yield success
