Getting set up for CSCI 161
***************************

Colab
=====

There are a few ways to get setup to start programming in Python. By far the **easiest** and **recommended** way for
CSCI 161 is to use `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb>`_.

There are a number of reasons this is the best choice for us, including being simple to setup (I'm betting everyone
already has a Google account). Further, it automatically backs everything up for you with Google Drive. Another big
reason is this style of programming, called *notebook*, is quite nice for note-taking.

If you do not have a Google account, then it is easy to make one. If you are uncomfortable making a Google account, then
no worries, either use the options below or make a Google account just for Colab.


Interpreter on Your Computer
============================

Colab is awesome, however it does have one major downside --- you **must** be connected to the internet for it to work.
Although we'll still primarily use Colab, it is recommended to also install Python on your computer. You'll pickup how
to use both Colab and your local interpreter throughout the course.

To download Python onto your computer, visit the `Python download page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_, download
it, and install.


Integrated Development Environment
==================================

If you would like, install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs are special programs that can make it easier to write code. **HOWEVER**, I don't actually recommend using this in the course, or at least not at the start. Although IDEs do absolutely make a programmers life easier, at this stage of learning it will very very likely just confuse you and impeded your learning. 

For Windows users, the good news is if you installed Anaconda you already have something called **Spyder** installed. This is an IDE that comes with Anaconda. 

Another popular IDE is **PyCharm**. `If you want it, download the free community edition (DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING).
<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download>`_

Note, I will not be providing IT support for IDEs (or really any IT support in general).
