* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* Ensure I have recorded your completion --- failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab

    * When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

.. note::

    To obtain full marks for the lab, you must:

        #. Have completed the pre-lab exercises
        #. Have been working on the lab content
        #. Demonstrate competency in the topics

Before Kattis
=============

#. Add to the ``Person`` class from the previous lab

    * A reasonable ``__repr__`` method --- you can decide what the string looks like
    * A reasonable ``__eq__`` method --- you can decide what it means for two ``Person`` objects to be equivalent


Kattis Problems
===============

Go back and work on Kattis problems you have yet to solve. I'm betting there are **A LOT** of the early ones you got stuck on that you could not demolish. 

Remember, the Kattis problems are great for practice, and practice is the only way to get good at programming. 

At this point, many of the not-so-difficult problems are totally doable by you now. If you're looking for more problems, or want more practice for tests, etc. sort the Kattis problems by difficulty and have fun. 

**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**
