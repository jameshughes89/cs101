* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* Ensure I have recorded your completion --- failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab

    * When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

Before Kattis
=============

We're going to do a bunch of linear searchers to start. 

**1**

Write a function ``char_is_in_while(character, phrase)`` that returns ``True`` if the letter ``character`` appears in the string ``phrase``, otherwise return ``False``. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 

**2**

Write a function ``char_is_in_for(character, phrase)`` that returns ``True`` if the letter ``character`` appears in the string ``phrase``, otherwise return ``False``. This function **must** use a *for* loop. 

**3**

Write a function ``where_is_while(character, phrase)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``character`` in ``phrase``, or return `-1` if it does not exist. This function **must** use a *while* loop. 


**4**

Write a function ``where_is_for(character, phrase)`` that returns the index of the first occurrence of ``character`` in ``phrase``, or return `-1` if it does not exist. This function **must** use a *for* loop.


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement. 

.. warning::
   
   If you get really stuck on any question, move on to the next one! Do not get bogged down.

If you finish this lab, go check out `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/>`_. Sort the problems by *Acceptance* (click the table header) and start seeing if you can solve some of these problems. 

**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**
