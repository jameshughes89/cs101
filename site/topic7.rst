The thing about strings
=======================
.. admonition:: Activity

    How is a string different from the other data types we've seen (``int``, ``float``, ``numpy.float32``, ``bool``)?
   
* I can print individual *characters* of a string, by *indexing* the string:

    >>> a='My little string'
    >>> print(a[0])
	M
    
	>>> print(a[1])
	y

* A *string* is just a... string... of *characters*
* In a *compound object*, indexing allows us to pick out individual components.
* Note that in Python, the first index is ``0``, not ``1``!
    * Whether to start at zero or one is an arbitrary decision made by programming language designers.
    * Is the "first floor" of a building the same as le "premier Ã©tage"? Natural language problem, too!
    * Python inherited the 0-based convention from C (this actually makes sense if/when you learn about memory pointers)
    * MATLAB inherited 1-based indexing from Fortran
    * This is a small gotcha for folks switching from one language to another; very easy to fix, but perplexing if you don't know to look for it!

.. admonition:: Activity

    Write a single line command to print the first 4 characters of some string ``a``. 
    
    How about the 2nd to 7th characters? 
    
    How about the last three characters? 
    
    *Hint*: what does a *negative* index do?
   
* Bonus if you're reading ahead: what does ``print(a[0:4])`` do?
* This is called *slicing* the string.

More loops
==========
* I can get the *length* of string like this:
    >>> len(a)
    15
    
* Let's apply that...

.. admonition:: Activity

    Write a function ``vert_print`` that takes a string as an argument and then uses a ``while`` loop to print each character on its own line. (See sample output below)
   
   >>> vert_print(a)
   M
   y
   _
   l
   i
   t
   t
   l
   e
   _
   s
   t
   r
   i
   n
   g

* The ``while`` loop certainly worked OK there, but it was a bit awkward.
* ``while`` loops are meant to continue until some logical condition is met.
    * Which this technically is, buttttt...
* Maybe there is another kind of loop that says "Do the indented code block once for each item in a compound object" rather than "Do the code block until an arbitrary condition is met".
* Such a thing exists: the ``for`` loop::

    for char in a:
        print(char)
      
* *for* each character in the string ``a``, we run the indented code block.
* You don't *have* to use the ``for`` loop. A ``while`` loop can do exactly the same thing.
* The ``for`` loop is just cleaner here (and less typing!).
* But there is nothing wrong with the ``while``! There are just a lot of ways to solve a problem.
* You can actually prove that there are a (countably) infinite number of programs to do any given task.
    * Some are just more efficient, and easier to read, than others.
   
Mutability
==========
* So... if we can *access* an individual character in a string with an index...
* ... you might be feeling tempted to try to *set* an individual character with an index, too.
* Let's try::
    >>> a[7]='X'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
* Variables of some types (like ``int``) are *mutable*... that is: they can be changed.
* Based on the above... do you think *strings* are mutable?
* You can't change a string. You have to make a *new one* based on the old one. 
    >>> new_a = a[:7] + 'X' + a[8:]
    >>> print(new_a)
    My littXe string

    Write a function ``char_is_in(char,string)`` that returns ``True`` if the character ``char`` appears in the string ``string``.
    
    * HINT: what does the ``in`` operator do in Python?

* You can do the above exercise the hard way, with loops, or you can look up ``in``.

.. admonition:: Tricky Activity

    What's wrong with this?::
   
        def char_is_in(char, string):
            count = 0
            while count < len(string):
                if string[count] == char:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
                count = count + 1

    * Try: `char_is_in('t', 'test')`
    * Try: `char_is_in('z', 'test')`
    * Try: `char_is_in('e', 'test')`

.. admonition:: Activity

    Write a function ``where_is(char,string)`` that returns the *index* of the first occurrence of ``char`` in ``string``.

String Trivia
=============
* ``''`` or ``""`` will work for the quotes needed for strings
    * But you can put ``''`` inside ``""`` s
   
    >>> a = "Hello, 'world'"
    >>> print(a)
    Hello, 'world'
   

* We can concatenate strings
    >>> a = 'FuN' + ' ' + 'tImEs'
    >>> print(a)
    FuN tImEs
   
* We can make a string repeat
    >>> a = 'FuN' * 3
    >>> print(a)
    FuNFuNFuN
   
* We can convert an ``int`` to a ``str``  
    >>> print(type(1))
    <class 'int'>
  
    >>> print(type(str(1)))
    <class 'str'>

* The string ``''`` is a string, but it's *empty*
    * This is a weirdly important detail actually

    >>> a = ''
    >>> print(len(a))
    0
   
    >>> print(type(a))
    <class 'str'>

* We have some special *characters* that we have no buttons for.
    * '\\\n'
    * '\\\t'
    * '\\\\'
    * There are a bunch 
    
    >>> a = 'hello\nWorld\tFUN\\!'
    >>> print(a)
    hello
    World   FUN\!	# A weird string
      
* ASCII Table
    * Every *character* is a *number*

    .. image:: ../img/ascii.gif
   
    >>> wut = ord('a')	# get the num of 'a'
    >>> print(wut)
    97
   
    >>> wut = chr(65)	# convert num to char
    >>> print(wut)
    A
   
Formatting output (the ol' trusty way)
======================================

**%.2f** (percent dot two eff)

* f is for float
* Right side of **.** is for decimal places

    >>> a = 1.235
    >>> print('Format to 2 decimal places: %.2f' %a) # it will round too!
    Format to 2 decimal places: 1.24		
  
    >>> b = 4.39999
    >>> print('a: %.2f b: %.4f' %(a, b))	# need parentheses if more than one value to be inserted
    a: 1.24 b: 4.4000
   
* Left side of **.** is for specifying total string length
   
    >>> a = 1.311
    >>> print('3 of the 5 chars: %5.1f' %(a))
    3 of the 5 chars:   1.3	# len('1.3') = 3
    
    >>> print('4 of the 5 chars: %5.2f' %(a))
    4 of the 5 chars:  1.31
   
    >>> print('5 of the 5 chars: %5.3f' %(a))
    5 of the 5 chars: 1.311

* Left justify 

    >>> a = 1.311
    >>> print('%-10.2f neato' % a)
    1.31       neato
    
    >>> print("%-10s%10.2f" %('Total:', a))
    Total:          1.31

* Many old programming languages do it this way
    * And there are a billion other options too
* `There are new ways to format your strings in Python though <https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python>`_
    * .format()
        * Probably the best way to do it in Python these days
    * f-strings
    * Check them out if you care

   
Objects
=======

.. warning::
   
    Some of the following is not actually true for Python, but will be the case for many of the commonly used programming languages. 
   
    Also, we will be going into more detail on Objects later in the class.

* We have seen *primitive* types
    * Int
    * Float
    * Booleans
   
* There are other *types*:
    * Strings (actually kinda' a primitive type in Python, but let's ignore this ...)
    * Numpy things 

* These are objects!
* We can even make our own *objects* 
    * stay tuned
* These objects act a little differently inside the computer 
    * For good reason too, but stay tuned. 


Methods
=======
* We've seen built in functions 
    * ``print('this is a function')``
* We've written our own functions
    * ``char_is_in('a','bleh')``

.. admonition:: Activity

    In Colab (or whatever IDE):
        1. Make a string
        2. Assign it to a variable (if using Colab, hit run too)
        3. Type the name of the variable
        4. Press dot (period)
        5. Wait... (or space or press ctrl-space (depends on IDE))

.. admonition:: Activity

    1. Try writing ``a_string.upper()`` and printing it out. 
    2. Try some other *methods*
   
* *Methods* are very very similar to *functions*
* But we're telling a specific *object* to do something
* Long story short:
    * Sometimes we do things with functions
    * Sometimes we do things with methods

BUT WAIT...
-----------

* Why do we have to do it like this ``a_string.upper()``
* As opposed to like this: ``upper(a_string)``

Answer
------

1. Because... 

2. ``upper(a_string)`` is not actually defined 

    * unless we define it ourselves

3. These methods were written by someone, and they wrote them to work a certain way

    * Not necessarily the best way, or a way you like

4. There's also a good bookkeeping argument too

    * Put all the string methods with the strings

5. But really... because
   

How are you supposed to keep track of what's what?
--------------------------------------------------

* Don't worry, you'll get it with practice
* Do note though, **the key is practice** 

Heavy lifting with strings
==========================
* If the program you are writing needs to do a lot of string manipulation, you probably want to
    >>> import string
* ... and `read about all the nifty stuff it does <http://docs.python.org/library/string.html>`_ 

For next class
==============

* Read `chapter 11 of the text <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html>`_
