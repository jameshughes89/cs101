General Assignment Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
***************************************************

* Does my text file have enough details?
	* Probably. The shorter the better. I really just want to see that you played around a little.

* Is my area a high/low enough density?
	* I really don't care how high/low it is. Just try a few things and see what you get.

* I don't know how to do *X*.
	* OK, go to `google.ca <https://www.google.ca>`_ and type in *X*.

* It’s not working, therefore Python is broken!
	* Probably not; you’re very likely doing something wrong

* My thing keeps telling me ``No such file or directory: 'starbucks2018.csv'``
	* Then the starbucks file probably isn't where python is looking.

* But density will grow larger the smaller I make the area.
	* Correct, you understand basic arithmetic.

* But I never used the one function!!!!1!
	* Fine, but write the code anyways and make sure it works.

* But the degrees values don't specify a cardinal direction!
	* Make use of changing +/- if you need to change hemispheres.

* Wtf do the functions do that you gave me?
	* Read the descriptions. Try figuring it out. This is actually part of the assignment learning objectives.

* Some of the code in the functions you gave us look like magic.
	* At this point it may seem that way, but by the end of the semester, they will lose their magic.

* Do I have enough comments?
	* I don't know, maybe? If the code is too complex to understand simply by looking at it, add a comment.

* I know you told me to do it this way, but I did it another way, and I think my way is better.
	* Your way may be better, but I don’t care. Do it the way I told you.

* Can I work with my friend?
	* No.

* I know I cheated, I know I know I was cheating, but I’m reeeeaaaaaaaaallllllly sorry [that I got caught]. Can we just ignore it this time?
	* Lol, no.

* If I submit it at 11:56pm, you’ll still mark it, right? I mean, commmmon!
	* No. 11:55pm and earlier is on time. Anything after 11:55pm is late. Anything late is not marked. It’s rather simple really.

* Moodle was totally broken, it’s not my fault it’s late.
	* Nice try.

* I accidentally submitted the wrong code. Here is the right code, but it’s late. But you can see that I submitted the wrong code on time! You’ll still accept it, right?
	* Do you think I was born yesterday? No.

* Will I really get 0 if I do the submission wrong? Like, what if I submit the .ipynb instead of the .py?
	* Yes, you'll really get a **ZERO**.
