Unittest
********

* You may have noticed that our simple ``assert`` tests are becoming more difficult to write as our programs grow in complexity
* For example, consider the ``Circle``, ``Point3D``, and ``Sphere`` classes

    * There is some setup required for tests (e.g. creating an instance of a class)
    * The ``assert`` tests get jumbled together
    * It is not easy to know what the test is testing just by doing a quick look
    * There are many similar tests with redundant test code

* Fortunately, Python provides tools for helping us test our code
