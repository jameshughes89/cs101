* Feel free to use your laptop if you have it
* Ensure I have recorded your completion --- failure to do so will result in a grade of 0
* I strongly encourage you to work with others in the lab

    * When you get stuck, do me a favour and ask those sitting around you for help
    * I want people to get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning is super effective

.. note::

    To obtain full marks for the lab, you must:

        #. Have completed the pre-lab exercises
        #. Have been working on the lab content
        #. Demonstrate competency in the topics


Pre Lab Exercises
=================

.. warning::

    You must have completed the specified exercises prior to the start of the lab. If you have not come to lab prepared,
    you will be asked to leave and you will obtain a grade of 0 for the lab.

    * 15 (use ``assert`` to test instead of their ``test`` function)


Before Kattis
=============

**1**

Write a *function* called ``count_to_n_w(n)`` to print a count from 0 to ``n-1``. This function should use a *while* loop. 


**2**

Write a function called ``add_one_n_times_w(a, n)`` that will add **one** to a number ``a`` a total of ``n`` times. In the end, have this function ``return`` the value. This function **must** use a ``while`` loop. It should work such that:

>>> ans = add_one_n_times(7, 5)
>>> print(ans)
12

**3**

Write a *function* called ``count_to_n_f(n)`` to print a count from 0 to ``n-1``. This function should use a *for* loop. **Hint:** `check out range. <https://www.google.ca/search?q=python+range+for+loop&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA808CA808&oq=python+range+for+loop&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2437j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>`_

**4**

Write another function called ``add_one_n_times_f(a, n)`` that will add **one** to a number ``a`` a total of ``n`` times, but this time with a ``for`` loop. 


Kattis Problems
===============

Grab a scrap piece of paper to start scratching your ideas down on paper. The problems are getting tricky enough where this really is becoming a requirement.

**ENSURE WE HAVE RECORDED YOUR COMPLETION. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF 0!**
