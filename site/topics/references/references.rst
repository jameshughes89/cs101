* It is important for us to have an idea of what exactly is stored in our variables

.. warning::

    The ideas below are presented at a very high level and are not quite entirely correct for Python and other similar
    programming languages. The differences come up in the nuances, but the following is sufficient to cover the
    important ideas that you need to know. In fact, where there are differences between the following and how Python
    actually works is not overly important for us, especially in introductory computer science.


.. note::

    We typically use *hexadecimal* (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) when referring to memory addresses,
    but for simplicity, we will use decimal numbers throughout this topic.

Fixed Size Arrays
-----------------
   
* Let's hit pause on lists for a sec and go back in time
* In many programming languages, lists aren't *free* like they are in Python
* Instead, we have *arrays*: Fixed size collections of data 
    * Like a list, but fixed size, and no fancy methods
        * BTW, the following is basically the same for lists too, but slightly easier to explain if we talk about arrays

* Above is an array with length **8**
    * No making fun of my *Microsoft Paint* skills
* The contents are labeled *a -- h*, but let's pretend they're numbers


Primitive Types in Memory (RAM)
-------------------------------

* Let's say we have a single integer called ``x`` (so, not an array anymore)
    * I know it's an ``x``, but let's pretend it's some value of type *int*
* An integer is a primitive type

.. warning::

    Unlike many languages, ints are actually *objects* in Python, but we're still ignoring this for now to learn an important concept from the olden days that still applies to Python due to conventions 
   
* We know how big an integer can be inside the computer (how much RAM an int takes up)
    * And why do we know how big it is? 
        * Because some engineer said so
    * Let's say an int can be *32-bits*
    * That's 32 0s and 1s
    * Ex: 00101010010010110101110100010100
        * That's 709,582,100 if anyone cares

* If we know how much RAM an int takes up, I can easily shove ints into nicely divvied up chunks of RAM, assuming each spot has 32 bits. 

* Let's say I type

>>> x = 17

.. image:: Int_in_RAM.png

* Something like this will happen. 
    * The value 17 will go into one of the open divvied up chunks of RAM
    * We create a label for the value called ``x``
   
* If I say something like

>>> y = x

.. image:: copy_int_in_RAM.png

* Something like this will happen. 
    * Copy the contents in the location that the ``x`` refers to some other location
    * Create a label for the copied value called ``y``
   
* **I COPY OVER THE CONTENTS OF X AND PUT IT INTO Y**

* So far this is fine and dandy
* But, what happens if we try to shove an array into one of those nicely divvied up chunks of RAM?
    * The RAM is divvied up to accept single ints
    * But we have an array of 8 ints...
    * PROBLEM!

* Wait, there's actually a simple solution. What if we block off chunks of RAM to be the array?
* So if I have the array ``[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]``, we get this...

.. image:: array_in_RAM.png

* We're just putting each element into it's own RAM location
* We just need to know that our array starts at memory address 677 and goes to 684.

* ... but... how do we keep track of this?

* Let's see what happens when we say this (people always say how complicated this is, but it's really not when you understand the intuition): 

>>> z = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]

.. image:: array_pointer.png

* ``z`` gets us to a memory location whose contents is another memory address
    * It effectively *points* to another chunk of RAM

.. admonition:: Activity
    :class: activity

    Take 1 min and look at this picture and see if you can explain why we start counting at 0 when indexing lists/arrays.
   

* Earlier we saw that lists work a little differently when saying something like

>>> my_list = [1,2,3]
>>> another_list = my_list
>>> another_list[1] = 99
>>> print(my_list)
[1, 99, 3]
 
* We called this aliasing and took note that it's weird
* However... actually... the way we copy over ``my_list`` to ``another_list`` works THE SAME WAY AS PRIMITIVE TYPES
    * But... You just said.. and you clearly showed us that it's totally different!!!!!!!!

* Strap yourselves in, because I'm about to blow your mind

* Let's say I write

>>> w = z

.. image:: array_pointer_copy.png


* Just follow the rules we followed for primitive types
   * Copy over the contents of z to an open memory location
   * Give it the label ``w``
   
* How many references do I now have that get me to the same memory location?

* Now let's look at what happens if I do this

>>> w[4] = P

.. image:: array_pointer_copy_change.png

* Did I change the contents at the memory location ``w``?
   * No, I changed something that the reference in the memory location ``w`` was pointing to!!

* Memory (typically) works like this for non-primitive types (objects)
   * Arrays
   * Lists
   * etc.
